## 💥 Why It Stands Out

- **Real-world-first**: Not just a chat app — this verifies *actual* gameplay
- **Map-based design**: Like Grab, but for sports battles
- **Built for Vietnam**: Local sport styles, language, and courts built-in
- **Scalable core**: Expandable to schools, clubs, and regional leagues

---

## 🤝 Get Involved

Looking for:
- UX/UI contributors
- Local players to test prototype
- Investors and sports ecosystem partners
